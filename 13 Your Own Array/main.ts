// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let favoriteTransportation = ["Bike", "Car", "Bus", "Train"];

console.log(`I would like to own a ${favoriteTransportation[0]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${favoriteTransportation[1]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${favoriteTransportation[2]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${favoriteTransportation[3]}.`);
